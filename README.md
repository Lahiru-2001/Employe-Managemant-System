# Tech Company HR Management System

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive HR Management System developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system facilitates HR managers and assistants in managing employee records, departments, designations, and other HR-related tasks. The project is accompanied by UML diagrams, including Use Case, Class, and Sequence Diagrams, to illustrate the system's functionality and architecture.

## Features
- **User Management**: Separate login functionality for HR Managers and Assistants.
- **Employee Management**: Add, search, and manage employee records using various filters such as department, employee ID, and EPF number.
- **Department & Designation Management**: Create and manage different departments and employee designations.
- **Account Creation**: HR Managers can create additional HR Assistant accounts.

## UML Diagrams
- **Use Case Diagram**: Illustrates the interactions between users (HR Manager, HR Assistant) and the system.
- **Class Diagram**: Displays the relationships between different classes, methods, and variables.
- **Sequence Diagram**: Describes the flow of activities within the system, such as HR Manager login, employee addition, and department management.

## Object-Oriented Concepts Applied
- **Objects**: Represent real-world entities containing information and behavior.
- **Classes**: Templates for creating objects that describe their structure and behavior.
- **Abstraction**: Reduces complexity by modeling essential features.
- **Inheritance**: Promotes code reuse by allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundles data and methods within a class and controls access through specified interfaces.
- **Polymorphism**: Enables interacting with different objects through a common interface.
